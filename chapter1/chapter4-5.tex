 	\section{Pulsar surveys}
        \subsection{Previous pulsar survey } \label{survey}
        \paragraph{} After the discovery of the first pulsar by ~\citep{HEWISH1968}, a couples of pulsar survey began. The first generation of pulsar survey mainly used low frequency ($~\sim$ 400 MHz) as the observed frequency with small bandwidth and frequency resolution. An examples of these survey is Molonglo transit survey ~\citep{Large:1968:mi}, ~\citep{Vaughan:1970:lm}, and ~\citep{Davies:1970:lm}. Even this survey is inefficient for detect high DM pulsar due to scattering effect is larger at high frequency. Moreover, this survey used bandwidth of 4MHz with only 2 channels which introduce larger DM smearing in one channel which could not be corrected using incoherent de-dispersion. The survey already found that pulsars are likely to be located in the Galactic plane. ~\cite{Hulse:1974:jh} introduces high sensitivity using Arecibo 305 m telescope. This survey  observed using 430 MHz with 8 MHz bandwidth with 32 channels leading to the discoveries of the Hulse-Taylor pulsar. The most successful in term of the number of discovered pulsar in the beginning pulsar search is the second Molonglo survey ~\citep{Manchester:1978:rl} which discovered 155 pulsars. As all of these pulsar surveys used low frequency observation ($~\sim$ 400 MHz), these survey is bias on high DM pulsar especially on the Galactic plane.  
        
        \paragraph{} The new era of pulsar survey began in late 1980 when observing pulsar at a relatively high frequency (1.4 GHz) shows benefits from reducing scattering effect from ISM (~\cite{johnston1992high} and ~\cite{clifton1992high}). However, as mentioned before that pulsars are normally weaker at high frequency because its have negative spectral index ~\citep{bates2013pulsar}. As pulsars are weaker in high frequency, the observation time will be longer. Longer observation time leads to longer processing time. Moreover, the angular resolution for high frequency observation is smaller than low frequency as Equation ~\ref{angular_res}. As a result, the pulsar survey in high frequency needs more pointing than a low-frequency survey to cover the same area on the sky. 
        
        \paragraph{} Commissioning of the multibeam receiver at Parks telescope ~\citep{staveley1997hi} introduces a new possibility of pulsar survey at high frequency with the multibeam receiver. The multibeam receiver is capable of observing 13 different patches of the sky simultaneously ~\citep{staveley1997hi} compromising disadvantage of observing at high frequency which has smaller angular resolution An example of the survey using multibeam receiver is Parkes multibeam pulsar survey (PMPS). PMPS is the most successful pulsar survey in the history by discovered over $30 \%$ of known pulsars with $t_{samp}=0.25 ms$ ~\cite{camilo2000parkes} and bandwidth of $288$ MHz  ~\cite{manchester2001parkes}. FFA was applied to PMPS leading to the discovery of PSR J1001-5939 with a period of 7.7 s ~\citep{Faulkner2004} and ~\citep{lorimer2006parkes}. After that, implementation of FPGA and digital filterbanks introduces observations in high time and frequency resolution. An example from these type of survey is the PALFA pulsar survey ~\citep{cordes2006arecibo} using the 305 m radio telescope at Arecibo. The PALFA survey has they own FFA pipeline which is in an ongoing process. The preliminary result can be found in  ~\cite{parent2018implementation} with result similar to ~\cite{cameron2017investigation}. Another example of a survey with high time resolution is the High Time Resolution Universe Survey (HTRU).
        
        \subsection{The High Time Resolution Universe survey}
		\paragraph{} The High Time Resolution Universe Survey (HTRU) is a project that consist of two blind pulsar surveys, the northern (HTRU-N) and southern (HTRU-S) survey. Combining these two survey will lead us to the most sensitive all-sky pulsar survey at 1.4GHz. HTRU-N began the survey campaign in 2011 and still on process while HTRU-S used the Parkes 64-m radio telescope located north of Parkes, New South Wales, Australia. HTRU-S data collection began in 2011 and finished in 2014. HTRU-S survey is divided into three regions by the Galactic latitude as shown in Figure ~\ref{HTRU_map}. In this work, only low-lat survey ($|b|<3.5^o$) will be mentioned, for more information about other surveys can be found at ~\cite{Andrew} and ~\cite{keith2010high}. HTRU-S used Parks Multibeam receiver which consists of 13 feeds producing 13 telescope beams on the sky. Beam patterns in the sky are shown in Figure ~\ref{HTRU_beam}. HTRU-S Low-lat has the longest observation time compare to other HTRU surveys ($t_{obs}$=4320 s) with $t_{samp}$ 64 $\mu s$ contains $2^{26}$ samples per observation. Longer observation time means more pulses with is necessary for finding slow pulsar which emits less pulses compare to fast pulsar in the same length of time. The central frequency $f_c$ is located at 1352 MHz with a bandwidth ($\Delta f$) of 340 MHz contains 870 channels ~\citep{keith2010high}. HTRU-S is a huge improvement from PMPS due to a finer sampling time, frequency channels and also longer integration time. Some highlighted discoveries from HTRU-S Low-lat are PSR J1101-6424, a recycled pulsar with massive WD companion, PSR J1847-0427, a pulsar with large pulse shape that almost entire pulse phase ~\citep{ng2015high}, and the most accelerated binary pulsar J1757-1854 ~\citep{cameron2018high}. However, the remains question is, do we detected all the pulsar in HTRU-S Low lat data? In this work, we applied acceleration-FFA search to HTRU-S Low-lat survey data and trying to answer this question. %Since FFA is focused in this work, we will talk only detailed about FFA here.

\section{FFA pipeline}
\paragraph{} In this work, the maximum search period range is constraint by the assumption that, to detect a pulsar in the FFA, we need at least ten pulses otherwise SP become more effective to search for a pulsar. As a result, the maximum search period in this work is 430s or $10\%$ of the integration time. The FFA needs more search trials for shorter period as shown in Table ~\ref{FFA_step} which means longer processing time. The minimum search period needs to be selected carefully. In this work, we used the shortest period that gives a reasonable computational time (less than 12 hours) which is 0.131 s. This number is chosen not only the short computational time but come with the condition of the FFA that the minimum search period need to be smaller than $bins /cdot t_{samp}$. This condition allows us to perform huge downsampling with a factor of 16 efficiently. The search is divided into 12 different search steps as the search step changes every time that the maximum period search follows the condition that $P_{max}=2 P_{min}$.       

%\paragraph{} The one of situation that the signal of the pulsar can be lost in FFA search is when the delay time across the whole bandwidth or observation time exceeds one profile bin as Figure ~\ref{diag}. As a result, the diagonal DM step (as Equation ~\ref{dm_step_dig}) and acceleration step (as Equation ~\ref{acc_step}) is used. Using parameter in this survey ($t_{obs},f_c,\delta f,t_{same}$), $DM_0$ and $a_0$ are determined as 3 $pc cm^{-3}$ and 1 $m/s^2$ respectively. Thus, when the search step change as period getting twice longer, the acceleration and DM step also change with the same factor. The maximum search DM is chosen from the fact that, HTRU-S low lat is the data from the densest region in the Galaxy. The maximum DM in this case is 3072 $cm^{-3}pc$. The maximum DM is originated from the nearest common factor for each DM step to 3000 $cm^{-3}pc$. DM of 3000 $cm^{-3}pc$  originate from the DM range of HTRU-S Low lat FFT pipeline DM range ~\citep{ng2015high}. The maximum acceleration range is calculated from the maximum acceleration produced by pulse-BH binary with $m_c=37 M_{\odot}$ which is $128 m/s^2$. The overall detail of this pipeline can be found at ~\ref{flow}. As DM and acceleration step changes with the searching period, this method demonstrates that acceleration search with FFA is highly optimised because the pipeline can skip some DM and a step when period got longer without losing any S/N. Moreover, De-dispersion and time domain re-sampling need to apply only with the finest step. The pipeline will skip some DM, and a step when searching period getting longer as shown in Figure ~\ref{FFA_process}. After reaching the maximum DM and acceleration, the pipeline will search for the periodicity in the time series that correspond to DM of 0 and 3072 $cm^{-3} pc$ and acceleration of -128.0,0, and 128.0 $m/s^2$ as show in Table~\ref{FFA_step}.
\paragraph{} The one of situation that the signal of the pulsar can be lost in FFA search is when the delay time across the whole bandwidth exceeds one profile bin as Figure ~\ref{diag}. As a result, the diagonal DM step (as Equation ~\ref{dm_step_dig}) is used. Using parameter in this survey ($t_{obs},f_c,\delta f,t_{same}$), $DM_0$ is determined as 3 $ cm^{-3}~pc$. Thus, when the search step change as period getting twice longer, the DM step also change with the same factor. The maximum search DM is chosen from the fact that, HTRU-S low lat is the data from the densest region in the Galaxy. The maximum DM in this case is 3072 $cm^{-3}pc$. The maximum DM is originated from the nearest common factor for each DM step to 3000 $cm^{-3}pc$. DM of 3000 $cm^{-3}pc$  originate from the DM range of HTRU-S Low lat FFT pipeline DM range ~\citep{ng2015high}. The overall detail of this pipeline can be found at ~\ref{flow}. As DM step changes with the searching period, this method demonstrates that acceleration search with FFA is highly optimised because the pipeline can skip some DM step when period got longer without losing any S/N. Moreover, De-dispersion need to apply only with the finest step. The pipeline will skip some DM step when searching period getting longer as shown in Figure ~\ref{FFA_process}. After reaching the maximum DM the pipeline will search for the periodicity in the time series that correspond to DM of 0 and 3072 $cm^{-3} pc$ as show in Table~\ref{FFA_step}. For aceration, Equation ~\ref{acc_step} shows that the first acceration step is 1 $m/s^2$. In the same logic, accleration steps can be optimize as the searching period getting longer. The maximum acceleration range is calculated from the maximum acceleration produced by pulse-BH binary with $m_c=37 M_{\odot}$ at orbital period of 12 hours which is $128 m/s^2$. The orbital period came from the "10 percent rule" where the constant acceration condition is applied when the observation time is 10 percent of the orbital period. 

\paragraph{} The pipeline used \textit{PRESTO} package to mask out the RFI using the package \textit{rfifind}. The de-dispersion process has been done with \textit{PRESTO} to produce de-dispersed time series. The time series will be re-sampled by python package \textit{sigpyproc}. The FFA search and sifting in period and DM part has been done in \textit{riptide} \footnote{https://bitbucket.org/vmorello/riptide/src/master}. The FFA search without acceleration search diagnosis plot for this pipeline is shown as an example in ~\ref{Fast_pulsar}. The sifting for acceleration domain has been done in this pipeline by grouping candidates that have period and DM in the same search bins. Then, the pipeline will search for the strongest candidate. The diagnosis plot for the full pipeline is shown as an example in ~\ref{J1746}

The original sampling time $t_{samp}$ is 1.024 ms. The sampling time for each period is selected from the fact that $t_{samp}$ for each period need to be at least $1/bins_{min}$ which can introduce huge downsampling factor $Df$. }

\chapter{Results}
	\section{Simulation of acceleration search in FFA } \label{AFFA}
  \paragraph{} To compare the performance of this pipeline to the no-acceleration FFA pipeline, acceleration search with FFA (AFFA) pipeline was applied to 5600 artificial pulsars generated by \textit{SIGPROC}'s \textit{fake} package. The simulated pulsars have spin periods randomly injected between 1.0 to 6.0 S, with pulse duty cycles $\delta$ randomly ranging from 1\% to 25\%. After that, we also generated pulsar with the same P and $\delta$ but with companion mass randomly generated between 0 to 96 $m/s^2$ at an orbital phase of 0.25 and an orbital period of 12 hours. All of the parameter are uniformly generated. After that, non-acceleration search FFA pipeline is applied to the non-accelerated pulsar while accelerated FFA pipeline will be applied to pulsar with companions. The simulations show that only 10\% of the data that AFFA can recover have the S/N less than 95\% as shown in Figure ~\ref{his}.
  
  \begin{figure}[h]

\includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{figures/dist_dash}
\caption{Cumulate distribution of simulated relative S/N.  Dash line shows the threshold  of 10\% of the whole data set. }\label{his}
\end{figure}

 \paragraph{} To investigate the origin of 10 \% of the synthetic pulsars that have relative S/N less than 95 \%. First, we checked on the relation between period and relative S/N as Figure ~\ref{P_twice}. The result shows that the relative S/N is uniformly distributed. Thus, there is no correlation between period and relative S/N.  After that, the relation between relative S/N and acceleration where acceleration is calculated from injected companion mass is studied as Figure ~\ref{a_twice}. The study shows some correlation between relative S/N and acceleration specifically at some specific acceleration, i.e. 16,32,64 $m/s^2$. We can see that this acceleration, the algorithm recover most of the signal. In the other hand, an acceleration of $\approx$ 14,25,50,84 $m/s^2$ the relative S/N approaching the local minimum in the plot. Another important parameter that we need to study is the duty circle $\delta$ as shown in ~\ref{duty_twice}. We assumed that the pulse could be smeared for eight bins and we also indicate the duty circle that equal to 8 bins. The result shows that most of the low relative S/N detections are originate from pulsars with duty circle below 6.25 \% or 8 profile bins which is basically outside our searching parameter.

\end{figure}

\paragraph{} Lastly, as we know that acceleration and duty circle contribute the detectability of the pipeline, the response pattern between acceleration and duty circle is investigated as ~\ref{a-d}. The result agrees well with the previous studies that both of the $\delta$ and acceleration are contributed to the detectability of synthetic pulsars. However, this implementation is relatively fast and require less number of operation. As a conclusion, this method can recover most of the pulsar signal (90 \%) in relative S/N range of 95\%.

	\section{New pulsars from AFFA}
  \paragraph{} In this section, I will talk about the preliminary result of applying AFFA to 122 observations from HTRU-S low-lat data. The pipeline full takes around 12 hours to complete. Even the pipeline has been apply to a small amount of data $~\sim 1 \%$, the pipeline discovered 3 new pulsar candidates. One of them is already confirmed. The follow-ups were done by observation at the same position on the sky using Parkes telescope. 

    \subsection{J1759-1903 missing pulsar from HTRU-S low lat pipeline }
   \paragraph{} As part of applying \textit{riptide} FFA search pipeline to HTRU-S Low-lat data. This pipeline found a pulsar that were missing from previous HTRU-S Low-lat FFT pipeline reported in ~\citep{Andrew} and ~\citep{Ng}. This pulsar was detected discovered in HTRU-S Med-lat  The diagnostic plot is shown in Figure ~\ref{missing}. This pulsar show the potential of FFA for discover missing pulsar from the survey. After the redetection with FFA pipeline, the same pointing is processed with HTRU-S low-lat FFT pipeline and inspected by eyes. The result from FFT pipeline shows that this known pulsar is detected in FFT pipeline but with low S/N. Human error might cause this pulsar to be missed.  
       \begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/missing.png}
\caption{Missing pulsar from HTRU-S Low-lat FFT pipeline}\label{missing}
\end{figure}

    \subsection{J1746-28}
    \paragraph{} The highlight of this thesis is the discovery of J1746-28, the pulsar located $~\approx$ 0.5 degree from the Galactic centre. J1746-28 has a spin period of 1.889 s and a DM of 1290 $cm^{-3}pc$ as discovered diagnostic plot shown in Figure ~\ref{J1746}.  Comparing of this pulsar period and DM with all known pulsar in a radius of $1^o$, we found that there is no pulsar in this area which indicates that this pulsar is the newly discovered pulsar. The confirmation of J1746-28 has been done by Parkes 64m telescope in April 2018 which is approximately seven years from the original detection. The follow up observation using the Parkes telescope shows detection of the pulsar at the similar period and DM. After that, the observation campaign has begun to observe this pulsar for every month for at least 72 minutes to get the better timing solution. Moreover, this pulsar needs long observation campaign to get timing solution including to locate the position of this pulsar in the $P-\dot{P}$ diagram. As mentioned before, location in $P-\dot{P}$ diagram can help us to understand $\tau_c$ and $B_{surf}$.

\end{figure}
      \subsection{Pulsar candidates}
      \paragraph{} Even two pulsar candidates is re-observed in the same position with The Parkes telescope, but there are no detection on those observations. However, since one of them has known pulsar on the same observation. This known pulsar is detected in original HTRU-S data but not the follow up observation. The non-detection of candidates and a know pulsars  might be originate from an RFI environment on that day that strong enough to change the dynamic range of the observation.

\section{Comparison between FFA pipeline and FFT pipeline }
    \paragraph{} To compare the real efficiency between FFA and FFT, 122 pointing with known pulsars that were detected in HTRU-S low-lat using the FFT pipeline were applied with AFFA pipeline. Pointing that were used are combinations of 20 pulsars that were used by ~\citep{cameron2017investigation} to test the behaviour of FFA on the real data set and 21 known pulsars selected by the date of observation to avoid selection effect of period S/N and DM. This combination not only gives test pulsars period well distributed since there are a few known long period pulsar but also allows us to compare this work to ~\citep{cameron2017investigation}. The period range of known pulsars is from 190 ms to 6000 ms. The pipeline used the same search parameter as mentioned before. 
    \paragraph{} For the FFT pipeline, the pipeline used \textit{PRESTO} package to mask out the RFI using the package \textit{rfifind} then de-dispersed using the detected DM mentioned in ~\cite{Andrew} and ~\cite{Ng}. Each time series is resampled with corresponding acceleration detected in ~\cite{Andrew} and ~\cite{Ng}. After that, each time series is processed through \textit{PRESTO} package \textit{SEEK} and \textit{best} to find the best candidate. The candidate is evaluated by eyes to find the strongest detection with the approximately same period with the period reported in ~\cite{Andrew} and ~\cite{Ng}.  The comparison between S/N from FFA to FFT is illustrated in Figure ~\ref{FFA_FFT_real}. The result agrees well with the simulation that FFA is better than FFT when the period is getting longer.

\end{figure}

    \section{Confirmation of a pulsar candidates from FAST telescope}
    \paragraph{} As a part of a collaboration between FAST (Five hundred meter Aperture Spherical Telescope) in China for FAST pulsar survey and Effelsberg for follow up all of the pulsar candidates. The demonstration of applying FFA to Effelsberg. The follow-up data off this are shown in Figure ~\ref{Fast_pulsar}. This pulsar which has a period $\approx$ 5000 ms.  The Effelsberg telescope has a strong RFI of $\approx$ 1000 ms. The $5^{th}$ harmonics of this RFI could effect folded profile of the pulsar. However, FFA performs matching filter which can separate the pulsar candidate from an RFI as ~\ref{fast_rfi}. This is showing the potential of FFA to detect a weak pulsar that has a spin period near the RFI and also demonstrate the possibility of apply FFA pipeline to other datasets.
